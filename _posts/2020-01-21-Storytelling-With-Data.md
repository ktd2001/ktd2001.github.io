Throughout a career, the data scientist will frequently communicate their analysis and conclusions to a variety of audiences, from stakeholders within an organization to hundreds of people at a conference. But unfortunately, learning the art of communication plays second fiddle to hard skill data science techniques such as machine learning and data visualization. Even if you believe this skill can be cultivated at the workplace through experience, we can all benefit from better communication. This post focuses on developing these communication skills, applicable to _all_ careers, by means of simplistic narrative structure.

<!--Stockton University's Data Science program believes communication is so important that a 6 week accelerated summer course is dedicated to the betterment of conveying information and ideas. The goals of the course are to learn to develop an argument from data science techniques, share ideas and knowledge with diverse audiences, and formulate a balanced perspective on an issue or topic from the field of data science. -->

**Disclaimer: I am not an expert in communication practices or with the And, But, Therefore template. I highly recommend this book for its explicit details in how to construct a narrative and humorous delivery.**

The book used for the course Communicating Data Stories is Randy Olsen's _Houston, We Have a Narrative_.{: .notice--info}

## Narrative Structure

Oslen's book posits the scientist is prone to experiencing _narrative deficiency_: an insufficent understanding of narrative, or not knowing how to apply the power of storytelling to their scientific work. He gives special importance to a call to action for scientists to develop _story sense_, or narrative intuition, which like most things in life, require practice before mastery is obtained. An effective way to develop narrative intuition is to prioritize simplistic narrative structure by using the [Dobzhansky Template](#dobzhansky-template), the [And, But Therefore](#and-but-therefore) template, and [McKee's Triangle](#mckee's-triangle)

<!-- and [ABT Use] -->

### Dobzhansky Template

Theodosius Dobzhansky was a famous geneticist who said one of the most important statements in biological philosophy: 

> "Nothing about biology makes sense _except_ in the light of evolution." 

This statement encapsules biology in context of evolution, which is the overarching narrative telling the story of how  different facets of biology, such as biochemistry, microbiology, and genetics, are tied together by the concept of evolution. 

This quote by Dobzhansky can be applied to any topic by making the template generic: 

Nothing about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ makes sense _except_ in the light of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

This template helps to find a central theme that embraces the heart and soul of the narrative. Finding the right words, especially for the second blank, takes practice and effort. If you are just lukewarm after proposing a plausible word, most likely there is a better word that will serve as the foundation for your story.

Here are a few other examples of the Dobzhansky template in action: 

1. Apple: Nothing about Apple Computers makes sense _except_ in the light of innovation. 

2. Wawa: Nothing about Wawa makes sense _except_ in the light of convenience ([Don't know what a Wawa is?](https://www.wawa.com)).

3. Tom Brady: Nothing about Tom Brady makes sense _except_ in the light of [discipline](https://nesn.com/2016/01/tom-brady-opens-up-about-his-discipline-which-could-be-qbs-top-trait/). 

For this post, a solid Dobzhansky statement would be:

> Nothing about **communication** makes sense except in the light of **simplicity** and **structure**.

Here is Dobzhansky's comments regarding a story that lack a central theme/focus: 

Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry factsâ€”some of them interesting or curious but making no meaningful picture as a whole.

During the brainstorming stages of a project, devote some time to thinking about an ideal Dobzansky template that establishes a central theme to guide your thinking process that ultimately creates a meaningful picture for your story. 

### And, But, Therefore

The And, But, Therefore (ABT) narrative structure is considered the "DNA of story" that serves to organize the writer's thoughts in a concise and compelling manner. ABT is the crux of any story. It is the essential components of the narrative that needs to be conveyed so the reader understands what is happening. The structure of ABT is the following: 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, therefore \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 


Here is ABT applied to _The Wizard of Oz_:

> There is a little girl living on a farm in Kansas, **and** her life is boring, **but** one day a tornado sweeps her away to the land of Oz, **therefore** she must undertake a journey to find her way home.

Simple, concise, and gets the main message of the movie across. Extremely powerful. Once you create this  template for a PowerPoint presentation for your day job or a semester long research paper, it is easy to reference your ABT template as a roadmap to a single cohesive idea that you want the audience to take away from your findings. 

The ABT follows the traditional three act play structure: beginning (thesis), middle (antithesis), and end (synthesis). The 'And' component establishes the situation, the 'But' establishes the conflict, and the 'Therefore' resolves the conflict. Olsen is credited for coining this template as 'ABT', this narrative structure has actually been intertwined with story for centuries. Although Olsen frequently bashes modern day scientists in his book, he acknowledges the communicative storytelling gifts of Watson and Crick, codiscoverers of the DNA molecule. It turns out they used the ABT framework with their landmark paper _Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids_:
