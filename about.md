Hello! My name is Keiana Dunn. I am a Data Scientist within NYC area.

## Background
I graduated University of California at Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science and Management. Exposure to the management of the well-being of animals in big pharma and best practices for data collections shifted my interests from applied sciences to the application of data. After research into the field of data science, I was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program, and graduated August 2018.

## Professional Experience
I was hired as a Marketing Data Analyst in April 2019 responsible for lead generation, lead quality assessment, and business intelligence and analytics for NewLane Finance, an equipment lease and finance company.

I also teach MGMT 3125 - Introduction to Data Visualization and GNM 2256 - Designing Graphs Seeing Numbers for undergraduate business analytics students to learn data storytelling by means of coherent, organized and interactive visualizations.
