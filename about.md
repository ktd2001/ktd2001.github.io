Hello! My name is Keiana Dunn. I am a Budding Data Scientist within NYC area.

## Background
I graduated University of California at Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science and Management. Exposure to managing the well-being of animals in big pharma and using best practices for animal model data collections shifted my interests from applied animal science to the application of data analytics. After research into the field of data science, I was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program, and graduated August 2019. I have a strong passion for learning which is why I enjoy this field so much. No matter what data I am looking at, there is always something to learn whether it's statistics from the actual dataset, new coding methods for creating beautiful data stories or challenging myself to become better within data science. Talk a look at some of my work in recent data posts.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with family (including the fury ones), rollerskating, and traveling. My goal is to visit ever roller rink in the country so head over to my photos to see which ones I've already been to.  

## Setup
My blog is hosted by Github Pages and was created using Jekyll Minimal Mistakes. The author Michael Rose provides great [documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) about setup for this template.
