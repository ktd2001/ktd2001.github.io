Hello! My name is Keiana Dunn. I am a Data Scientist within NYC area.

## Background
I graduated University of California at Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science and Management. Exposure to the managing the well-being of animals in big pharma and best practices for animal model data collections shifted my interests from applied animal science to the application of data analytics. After research into the field of data science, I was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program, and graduated August 2019.
